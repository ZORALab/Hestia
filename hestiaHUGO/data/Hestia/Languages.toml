# HESTIA LANGUAGES SETTINGS
# -------------------------
# Due to the support for WASM, there is a tendency that the i18n can be
# implemented in there and completely discarding Hugo multilingual feature at
# all. Therefore, Hestia has to supply its own i18n feature and no longer
# depends on Hugo's multilingual feature for said flexibility and keeping the
# Hugo module development and communications consistent.
#
# This i18n multiple languages settings were designed to comply with:
#   1. RFC5646 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html)
#   2. ISO639 (https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html)
#   3. Searchable ISO639 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
#   4. ISO3166 (https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
#   5. Searchable ISO3166 (https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search)
#   6. ISO15924 (https://www.iso.org/standard/81905.html)
#   7. Searchable ISO15924 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_159240)
#
#
#
#
# CODE FIELD
# To comply all the standards above, the .Code field shall be in this pattern:
#                           [LANG]{-[COUNTRY]}
# Where [LANG] can be ISO639 or ISO15924 value while [COUNTRY] is ISO3166 value.
# It is optional to provie COUNTRY field. Should that is done, the final dash
# separating them can be removed. Example:
#     English (International)            = 'en'
#     English (United States)            = 'en-us'
#     English (China)                    = 'en-cn'
#     English (Malaysia)                 = 'en-my'
#     Simplified Chinese (International) = 'zh-hans'
#     Simplified Chinese (United States) = 'zh-hans-us'
#     Simplified Chinese (China)         = 'zh-hans-cn'
#     Simplified Chinese (Malaysia)      = 'zh-hans-my'
#
#
# ID FIELD
# The grouping id is mainly for internal use for language identification. It can
# be anything but it's recommended to stick to .Code field for consistency
# purposes.
#
#
# NAME FIELD
# The full name of the language in the targeted language. This is used for
# displaying translation options (e.g. a translator selector box to redirect
# user).
#
#
# DIRECTORY FIELD
# The directory pathing for the selected language inside Hugo's 'docs/'
# directory. Hestia learns this and setup necessary utilities (e.g. sitemap,
# 404 language redirect, etc).
#
#
# DIRECTION FIELD
# The direction of the text field. Value is EITHER 'left-to-right' OR
# 'right-to-left' ONLY depending on the language. Default is 'left-to-right'.
#
#
# URL_404 FIELD
# The Hestia compatible 404 page URL for that specific language.
#
#
# URL_Offline FIELD
# The Hestia compatible offline page URL for that specific language.
#
#
# The data structure pattern for a language is as follows:
#                [ID]
#                Code        = "[CODE]{-[COUNTRY]}"
#                Name        = "[NAME]"
#                Directory   = "[DIRECTORY]"
#                Direction   = "[DIRECTION]"
#                URL_404     = "[URL_404]"
#                URL_Offline = "[URL_Offline]"
# By default, Hestia supplies international English and Simplified Chinese. You
# can add/modify/remove them according to your site content and design.
