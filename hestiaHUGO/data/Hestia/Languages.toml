# HESTIA LANGUAGES SETTINGS
# -------------------------
# Due to the support for WASM, there is a tendency that the i18n can be
# implemented in there and completely discarding Hugo multilingual feature at
# all. Therefore, Hestia has to supply its own i18n feature and no longer
# depends on Hugo's multilingual feature for said flexibility and keeping the
# Hugo module development and communications consistent.
#
#
#
#
# CODE FIELD
# This i18n multiple languages settings were designed to comply with:
#   1. ISO639 (https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html)
#   2. Searchable ISO639 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
#   3. ISO15924 (https://www.iso.org/standard/81905.html)
#   4. Searchable ISO15924 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_159240)
#   5. ISO3166 (https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
#   6. Searchable ISO3166 (https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search)
# To comply all the standards above, the .Code field shall be in this pattern:
#                        {[lang]}{-[Script]}{-[COUNTRY]}
# Where:
#    1. [lang] is the ISO639 lowercase value;
#    2. [Script] is the ISO15924 compliant titlecase value;
#    3. [COUNTRY] is the ISO3166 compliant UPPERCASE value.
# It is optional to provide [Script] and [COUNTRY] fields. Should any of them
# be absent, their corresponding dash before them can be removed. Example:
#     English (International)             = 'en'
#     English (United States)             = 'en-US'
#     English (China)                     = 'en-CN'
#     English (Malaysia)                  = 'en-MY'
#     Chinese (International)             = 'zh'
#     Chinese (United States)             = 'zh-US'
#     Chinese (China)                     = 'zh-CN'
#     Chinese (Malaysia)                  = 'zh-MY'
#     Simplified Chinese (International)  = 'zh-Hans'
#     Simplified Chinese (United States)  = 'zh-Hans-US'
#     Simplified Chinese (China)          = 'zh-Hans-CN'
#     Simplified Chinese (Malaysia)       = 'zh-Hans-MY'
#     Traditional Chinese (International) = 'zh-Hant'
#     Traditional Chinese (United States) = 'zh-Hant-US'
#     Traditional Chinese (China)         = 'zh-Hant-CN'
#     Traditional Chinese (Malaysia)      = 'zh-Hant-MY'
#
#
# NAME FIELD
# The full name of the language in the targeted language. This is used for
# displaying translation options (e.g. a translator selector box to redirect
# user).
#
#
# DIRECTORY FIELD
# The relative directory pathing for the selected language inside Hugo's 'docs/'
# directory. Hestia learns this and setup necessary utilities (e.g. sitemap,
# 404 language redirect, etc).
#
#
# DIRECTION FIELD
# The direction of the text field. Value is EITHER 'left-to-right' OR
# 'right-to-left' ONLY depending on the language. Default is 'left-to-right'.
#
#
# DEFAULT FIELD
# Denotes the default language. ONLY ONE (1) of all can be set to true.
#
#
# URL.ERROR_404 FIELD
# The Hestia compatible 404 page URL for that specific language.
#
#
# URL.ERROR_Offline FIELD
# The Hestia compatible offline page URL for that specific language.
#
#
# The data structure pattern for a language is as follows:
#                [{[code]}{-[Script]}{-[COUNTRY]}]
#                Name        = "[NAME]"
#                Directory   = "[DIRECTORY]"
#                Direction   = "[DIRECTION]"
#
#                [{[code]}{-[Script]}{-[COUNTRY]}.URL]
#                ERROR_404     = "[URL.ERROR_404]"
#                ERROR_Offline = "[URL.ERROR_Offline]"
# By default, Hestia supplies international English and Simplified Chinese. You
# can add|modify|remove them according to your site content and design.
