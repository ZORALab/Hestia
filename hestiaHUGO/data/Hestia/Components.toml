# HESTIA SITE-LEVEL WEB UI COMPONENTS LIST
# ========================================
# All Hestia internal web UI components at site-level configurations. These
# configurations can be overwritten by page specific ones whenever available.
# The components low-level codes are auto-generated from hestiaGO code libraries
# to retain its UI rendering consistency between non-WASM users and WASM users.
#
# If you're using WASM from Hestia code libraries and directly control the page
# UI (either as single-page rendering or reactive rendering), you **SHOULD NOT**
# include anything below as they're redundant and can cause complications to
# your WASM rendering. Please stick to one type.
#
# You SHOULD ONLY include components that are used across all pages. To
# configure:
#     [COMPONENT].Enabled   = to include the component.
#     [COMPONENT].Variables = overwrites the component's variables.
#
# The data structure is as follows:
#               [{COMPONENT}]
#               Include = false
#
#               [{COMPONENTS}.Variables]
#               "{{ CSS Variable Name }}" = "{{ CSS Value }}"
#
#         Example:
#               [anchor]
#               Include = false
#
#               [anchor.Variables]
#               "--anchor-color" = "red"
