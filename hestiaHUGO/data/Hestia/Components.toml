# HESTIA WEB UI COMPONENTS LIST
# =============================
# All Hestia internal web UI components site-level configurations. These
# configurations can be overwritten by page-level ones when made available.
#
# The components are auto-generated from hestiaGO code libraries and are meant
# for those who use hestiaHUGO without WASM.
#
# If you're using WASM from Hestia code libraries and directly control the page
# UI (either single-page rendering or reactive rendering), you **SHOULD NOT**
# include anything below as they're redundant copies.
#
# To configure:
#     [COMPONENT].Enabled   = to include the component.
#     [COMPONENT].Variables = overwrites the component's variables.
#
# The data structure is as follows:
#               [{COMPONENT}]
#               Include = false
#
#               [{COMPONENTS}.Variables]
#               "{{ CSS Variable Name }}" = "{{ CSS Value }}"
#
#         Example:
#
#               [anchor]
#               Include = false
#
#               [anchor.Variables]
#               "--url-color" = "red"
[anchor]
Include = false

[anchor.Variables]
"--url-color" = "red"
