# JAVSCRIPT RENDERING CONFIGURATIONS
# ==================================
# To configure all JS rendering settings at site-level.
#
# Position.InlineFirst    - set renderer to render JS .Include List first
#                           before JS Inline List. Default is true.
#
# Timing.Inline           - set the timing for rendering inline Javascript. Only
#                           accepts the following values:
#                              1. 'defer' - set it to "type='module'" and
#                                           execute the asset in sequenced with
#                                           other JS assets only after DOM
#                                           completion.
#                              2. 'sync'  - block DOM rendering and execute the
#                                           assets immediately and regardlessly.
