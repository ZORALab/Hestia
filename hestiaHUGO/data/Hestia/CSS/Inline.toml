# CSS ARTIFACTS INLINE COMPLIATION LIST
# =====================================
#
# All CSS files shall be stored inside Hugo assets/ directory. Recommended place
# everything under assets/css/ directory for tidiness.
#
# Then map the CSS artifacts here in the sequences you wanted. The .Path is the
# relative pathing inside assets/ directory. Example, for the artifact placed in
#          assets storage directory:    assets/
#          artifact location       :    assets/css/my-site.min.css
#          .Path value             :           css/my-site.min.css
#
# The data pattern is as follows:
#                        [[Contents]]
#                        Path = '{.Path}'
#
# To add more CSS artifacts, simply append more data patterns below. Note that
# the position of the artifact dictates the sequences of its compilations.
