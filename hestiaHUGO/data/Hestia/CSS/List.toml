# CSS ARTIFACTS SITE-LEVEL ASSETS LIST
# =====================================
# You can include or inline CSS assets into this specific page only by listing
# out their .URL or relative file .PATH sources respectively.
#
# All .Inline CSS artifacts shall only be provided with Hugo's virtual pathing
# only.
#
# As For .Include CSS artifacts, Hestia's URL processing is available for
# dynamic relative pathing constructions. As long as the URL is accessible,
# storing location is not restricted to any single location.
#
# Example, for the artifact placed in:
#          assets storage directory =    assets/
#          artifact location        =    assets/css/my-site.min.css
#          .Inline value            =    assets/css/my-site.min.css
#          .Include value           =    NOT APPLICABLE
#
#          page storage directory   =    en/my-page-here/
#          artifact location        =    en/my-page-here/my-page.min.css
#          .Inline value            =    en/my-page-here/my-page.min.css
#          .Include value           =    /en/my-page-here/my-page.min.css
#
#          static storage directory =    static/css/
#          artifact location        =    static/css/my-page.min.css
#          .Inline value            =    NOT APPLICABLE
#          .Include value           =    /css/my-page.min.css
#
# The data structure pattern is as follows:
#                  [[Inline]]
#                  Path = '{{ .Inline }}'
#
#                         OR
#
#                  [[Include]]
#                  URL = '{{ .Include }}'
#                  Media = '{{ .Include.Media }}'
#                  OnLoad = '{{ .Include.OnLoad }}'
#
# To add more entries into either list, simply append new data structure below.
# The position of the entries dictates the rendering sequence of its statement.
#
# For .Include list, should .Media or .Onload is used for asynchonous loading,
# there is no guarentee for the actual CSS loading sequences (see:
# https://web.dev/critical-rendering-path-render-blocking-css/). When in doubt,
# leaving them blank will be the wisest choice.
