# strictly SVG image, beyond or equal to 1500x1500 square-only size, ONLY
# monochrome color (e.g. greyscale / black-white color).
# NOTE:
#  1. Apple Safari automatically process the monochrome logo where transprent is
#     equal to pixel. For a lot of cases, the Hugo image processing can yields
#     artistically invalid output. Since this is a brand / trademark image,
#     it can leads to potentially causing unwanted copyright legal proceedings.
#  2. Therefore, it's better to supply a dedicated SVG image instead of relying
#      solely on Hugo automated image processing.
