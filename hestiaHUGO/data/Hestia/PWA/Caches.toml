#   Policy   - Default Caching policy. They can only be the following values:
#             'cache-first'      - Default. Resource shall use the cache version
#                                  first and then perform a network update on it
#                                  in the background. The updated resource shall
#                                  be used in the next serving. Error shall be
#                                  returned if both cached resource and network
#                                  fetched resource are simultenously
#                                  unavailable.
#                                  USED FOR:
#                                    1. fastest response.

#                                  COMPROMISE:
#                                    1. not always up-to-date. Updated resource
#                                       only seen in next serving.
#
#             'network-first'    - Opposite of 'cache-first'. Resource shall use

#                                  update the cache. If network fetching fails
#                                  (e.g. offline), the local cache version is
#                                  then used. Error shall be returned if both
#                                  cached resource and network fetched resource
#                                  are simultenously unavailable.

#                                    1. slower response - due to waiting for
#                                       network for updated content.
