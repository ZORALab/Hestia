# Shortcuts are the list of shortcut items for easier PWA interactions.
# The list is grouped by numeric key (e.g. '0') for setting the order of the
# Shortcuts list. See:
#       https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/shortcuts
#
# To add more shortcut, simply add additional [Contents.N] data entries with
# unique 'N'. Having the same 'N' will make the latter overwrites the former
# one.
#
# Helper for 1 content dataset:
# Description - A short description of the shortcut. Recommended max 80
#               characters active voice approach (e.g. "Get Today's Weather").
# URL         - The activation URL. If left empty, the Shortcut shall be
#               completely discarded.
# Name        - The shortcut display name. If any of them left empty, the
#               Shortcut shall be completely discarded.
# Name.Full   - Full is the full shortcut name to display in a context menu.
# Name.Short  - Short is the shortest shortcut name to display in a context menu
#               where Name.Full is not applicable due to insufficient spaces.
#               Recommended Max 2 words.
# Icons       - Array list of icon images for the shortcut. If facilitated, the
#               '96x96' pixel sized icon is compulsory to be one of them.
#               A shortcut can have many icons with different sizes. Recommended
#               dimension is square.
# Icons.X.Design - it is the art purpose of the image which can be any of the
#                  following:
#                  1. 'any'        - used in any context (default)
#                  2. 'maskable'   - used for masked icons. Favicons with
#                                    'mask icon' is included.
#                  3. 'monochrome' - used for monochromatic context. Only alpha
#                                    level is used.
