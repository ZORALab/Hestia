# HESTIA PWA DISPLAY CONFIGURATIONS
# =================================
# Main PWA settings. Arranged in fallback priorities:
#   1. 'fullscreen' - basically takes over the entire screen.
#   2. 'standalone' - open like a native app (with no browser UI feels).
#   3. 'minimal-ui' - with minimum UI (e.g. refresh and back buttons).
#   4. 'browser'    - shows in browser mode.
#
# NOTE:
#   1. Safari iOS and ipadOS both does not support 'minimal-ui' and will
#      fallback to 'browser' automatically. See:
#                   https://web.dev/learn/pwa/app-design/
#
# To check for support, please see:

#   2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest#browser_compatibility
#   3. https://w3c.github.io/manifest/#dfn-fallback-display-mode
#
# .Overrides are the list of display modes for rendering before falling back to
# .Main display. The position denotes their respective priorities and fallback
# pattern. The last will be the one defined in .Main field. See:
#   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/display_override
