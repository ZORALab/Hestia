# Main PWA settings. Arranged in fallback priorities:
#   1. 'fullscreen' - basically takes over the entire screen.
#   2. 'standalone' - open like a native app (with no browser UI feels).
#   3. 'minimal-ui' - with minimum UI (e.g. refresh and back buttons).
#   4. 'browser'    - shows in browser mode.
#
# NOTE:
#   1. Safari iOS and ipadOS both does not support 'minimal-ui' and will
#      fallback to 'browser' automatically. See:
#      https://web.dev/learn/pwa/app-design/

# .Overrides are the list of display modes for rendering before falling back to
# .Main display. The position denotes their respective priorities and fallback
# pattern. The last will be the one defined in .Main field. See:
