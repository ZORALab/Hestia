# Strictly beyond or equal to 1200x1200 square-only size, without transparent
# pixels whenever possible.
# NOTE:
#   1. Apple iOS app icons automatically recolor transparent to black (#000000).
#      Please make sure you supply a no-transparent square PNG image.
#   2. Some stylish browser may have customizable tab color or background that
#      can recolor the favicon transparent pixels, making the brand logo outside
#      of your control.
#   3. Hestia will recolor transparent background with the color defined in
#      .Hestia.PWA.Colors.Background upon creating all the various icon sizes.
#   4. It was a known issue that Hugo's image processing cannot convert SVG into
#      PNG type. Hence, please supply non-vector image here. For vector format,
#      use the .Vector dataset.

[Monochrome]
# Strictly beyond or equal to 1500x1500 square-only size, ONLY monochrome color
# (e.g. greyscale / black-white color).
# NOTE:
#  1. Apple Safari automatically process the monochrome logo where transprent is
#     equal to pixel. For a lot of cases, the Hugo image processing can yields
#     artistically invalid output. Since this is a brand / trademark image,
#     it can leads to potentially causing unwanted copyright legal proceedings.
#  2. Therefore, it's better to supply a dedicated SVG image instead of relying
#      solely on Hugo automated image processing.
