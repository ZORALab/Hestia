# Strictly beyond or equal to 1500x1500 square-only size, ONLY monochrome color
# (e.g. greyscale / black-white color) and in SVG vector format.
#
# NOTE:
#  1. Due to the monochrome requirement, for a lot of cases, the Hugo image
#     processing can yields invalid artistic error. Since this is a brand /
#     trademark image, it is your responsbility to provide the required artwork
#     for this requirement.
#  2. Apple Safari automatically process the monochrome logo complying to the
#     PWA.Colors.Main color. Therefore, it's better to supply a dedicated SVG
#     image instead.
#  3. This will only be used in website favicon rendering.

# Strictly beyond or equal to 1200x580.65 rectangular size, png format, and no
# transparent pixel.
#
# NOTE:
#   1. Hestia will resize the icon over to applicable icons.
#   2. Acutal wide banner is 310x150 size. Providing larger size is for Hugo
#      to maintain decent and acceptable quality after its resizing compression.
#   3. Windows OS tile uses 2 sqaure lots with padding on start menu. Make it
#      stylish without any transparent background. Note that it might recolor
#      recolor transparent to unpredictable color.
#   4. Avoid spending too much effort in this banner since Microsoft deprecated
#      IE browser and also browserconfig.xml implementations. They have yet to
#      remove them so we still have to support said feature.
