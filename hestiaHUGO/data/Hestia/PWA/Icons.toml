# NOTE:
#   1. Hestia will resize the icon over to applicable icons.
#   2. Acutal wide banner is 310x150 size. Providing larger size is for Hugo
#      to maintain decent and acceptable quality after its resizing compression.
#   3. Windows OS tile uses 2 sqaure lots with padding on start menu. Make it
#      stylish without any transparent background. Note that it might recolor
#      recolor transparent to unpredictable color.
#   4. Avoid spending too much effort in this banner since Microsoft deprecated
#      IE browser and also browserconfig.xml implementations. They have yet to
#      remove them so we still have to support said feature.
