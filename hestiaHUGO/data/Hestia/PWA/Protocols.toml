# HESTIA PWA PROTOCOLS CONFIGURATIONS
# ===================================
# Protocols allow local OS URI application calls.
#
# .Protocol    - the custom protocol that will launch your application for data
#                processing (e.g. 'mailto' will launch the client email app).
#                You do not need to supply the '://' protocol suffix as the PWA
#                supported browser shall handle them accordingly.
#
# .URL         - the URL to service the local OS URI application call. The '%s'
#                is the placeholder value for local OS URI to feed into your
#                app. Hence, you can use URL's parameters to manage the input to
#                the page that is in-charge of processing the data. The default
#                here is set to 'query' against the base URL.
#
# To add more protocols, simply add more `[[Contents]]` dataset below.
