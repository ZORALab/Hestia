# HESTIA MULTIPLE FORMATS CONFIGURATIONS
# ======================================
# Due to the various modes of presenting a page, Hestia takes over Hugo's role
# of generating all necessary output files for the entire repository.




# By default, ZORALab's Hestia uses discovery methods to handle the entire
# repository without hardcoding into a single file (that will hit hard limits
# of 50000 URLs). There will be 2 files for EACH PAGE:
#   1. 'Index' type - (the conventional 'sitemap.xml') for discovery where it
#                     lists its current page alongside all child pages' 'Index'
#                     sitemap XML files.
#   2. 'Page' type  - content of the current page's sitemap data that will be
#                     mapped into its corresponding 'Index' sitemap.
#
# When summitting to SEO engine, please ONLY submit the 'Index' one at the root
# of the repository. Supported engine shall be able to self-discover recursively
# down your directories.
#
# File extension shall always be '.xml'. E.g. if 'Index' is 'sitemap', the
# generated output filename is 'sitemap.xml'.
[Sitemap]
Index = 'sitemap'
Page = 'sitemap-page'




# By default, ZORALab's Hestia only generates the following outputs listed in
# .List map table. Example:
#
#        [List.HTML]
#        Type = 'text/html'
#        Filename = 'index'
#        Extension = '.html'
#        Protocol = 'http://'
#        Relationship = 'canonical'
#        Marshallable = false
#
# Explaination:
# [List.{NAME}]            - unique name for the format type. Will be
#                            transformed into uppercase (e.g. 'html' -> 'HTML').
#                            If more than 2 tables with same name appeared,
#                            either error shall be raised or the latest shall
#                            dominate the former.
# List.{NAME}.Type         - MIME type value in lowercase (e.g. 'text/html').
# List.{NAME}.Filename     - Filename of the generated output (e.g. 'index').
# List.{NAME}.Extension    - File extension of the generated output (e.g. '.html').
# List.{NAME}.Protocol     - URL protocol for browsing the file (e.g. 'https://').
# List.{NAME}.Relationship - Relationship to the index.html file (e.g. 'alternate').
# List.{NAME}.Marshallable - The output can be parsed as dataset (true/false).
#
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# 1. 'HTML' is always being rendered by default. Hence, DO NOT REMOVE OR
#    OVERWRITE IT.
# 2. To disable a format (e.g. 'JSON'), simply remove/comment the entire table
#    off the list.
[List.HTML]

[List.JSON]
