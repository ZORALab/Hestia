# HESTIA IN-PAGE DEBUGGER
# =======================
# All Hestia's in-page data debugger's configurations. Debugger is only being
# added by UI component data processor **in server mode only**. It is forseeable
# that folks may upstream and made different types of debugger in the future so
# a config panel is required.
#
# 1) Default.Type           - Select the default debugger type. It must be a
#                             component in Hestia. Leaving it blank disables the
#                             debugger entirely.
