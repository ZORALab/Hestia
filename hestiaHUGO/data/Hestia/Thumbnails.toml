# Hestia SITE-LEVEL thumbnails configurations
# -------------------------------------------
# By default, Hestia supplies 3 dataset of thumbnails the 1200x630, 480x480, and
# 1200x1200 PNG format images mainly used across social network via OpenGraph
# or their own requirements. It re-uses the banner and images used by PWA and
# Favicons to keep the dataset lean, consistent, and efficient.
#
# Site-level thumbnails are the fallbacks of thumbnails should a page fails to
# deliver a set of them.
#
# Each image complies to the Hestia's Media data structure for image.
#
# Hugo's and Go's data processor is available in case you want to fill in a
# dynamic data.
#
# Although the configurations permit multiple sources, only the first source
# is selected for rendering in the case of OpenGraph. For specialized thumbnail
# requirement, a built-in aspect ratio detection algorithm shall be ran to
# select the best suitable thumbnail matching the requirement.
