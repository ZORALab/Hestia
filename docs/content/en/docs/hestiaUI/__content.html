		<h2>Business Direction</h2>
		<p>
			As the name implies, this section is all about
			assimilating or developing new or existing human
			interactive functional user-interfaces deployed across
			various technologies. The idea is to secure and to
			facilitate all available functional UI artwork to an
			existing and future projects use.
		</p>
		<p>
			In short, this is the programmable artwork division of
			the ZORALab's Hestia Project.
		</p>
	</section>


	<section id="compulsory-requirements">
		<h2>Compulsory Requirements</h2>
		<p>
			After the first successful HestiaUI implementations,
			there are some known requirements that are
			<b>non-compromising</b> in order to keep ZORALab's
			Hestia project maintainable.
		</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Always Componentize</h3>
			<p>
				There are too many user interfaces in this world
				contributing to different forms of interactions.
				Some are context-dependent while some are
				uniquely tied to an art direction. To manage
				them in the same repository can be a daunting
				task. In any case, <b>every UI parts MUST ALWAYS
				be a component stating its inter-dependencies
				of one another</b>.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Secondly, the only sensible way of testing UI
				is having human to test it. Therefore, keeping
				the UI as a small and modular compoment makes
				regression testing a lot easier to manage with.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Regressively Testable</h3>
			<p>
				<b>ZORALab's Hestia is a continuously improved
				project: testing regressively is a staple
				practice here</b>. This includes art-related UI
				design work.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Currently, ZORALab's Hestia had chosen
				<a href='https://gohugo.io/'>Hugo</a> as its
				primary engine to develop and test graphical
				UI designs. Hence, please ensure all UI designs
				are visually and interactively tested by humans.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Avoid Copyrightable Multimedia Dependencies</h3>
			<p>
				Unless you plan to sponsor the IP attorney fees
				for processing the re-distributable multimedia
				contents (e.g. picture, video, audio, etc.)
				written licenses (e.g. individual model release
				form, unlimited publications and redistribution
				right agreement, etc),<b> please forbid any
				component design from being locked to 1 or more
				media file(s)</b>.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				You can either <i>contribute media files that
				are code based (e.g. svg files) compatible with
				ZORALab's licenses</i> OR <i>document the
				instructions and let user to fill in his/her own
				media materials</i>. <b>DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE
				UNAUTHORIZED OR WORSE, UNLICENSED COPYRIGHTED
				MATERIALS</b>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Maximizing Technological Portabilities</h3>
			<p>
				UI is an art; it has to be portable in nature.
				Folks will use this project for various kinds
				of deployment and use cases. At least for web
				technologies: <code>CSS-only</code>,
				<code>CSS+JS</code>, and <code>CSS+WASM</code>
				use cases are supported by ZORALab's Hestia.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				So for the next component design, <b>please keep
				it portable and translatable from one technology
				to another easily</b>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Keep Innovation Door Open</h3>
			<p>
				As the next generation artificial intelligence
				technologies are on the rise for generative
				applications, <b>ZORALab's Hestia intend to
				embrace and welcome new AI technologies</b>.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Please keep the door open for new techniques and
				ideas from the new technologies.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Avoid Vendor Locked-In</h3>
			<p>
				Please avoid vendor-specific features (e.g.
				Hugo shortocode) whenever possible. <b>Your
				UI design shall be implementable across various
				technologies not limited to web only
				(e.g. <code>Qt5</code>).</b>
			</p>
