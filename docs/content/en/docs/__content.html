		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>
			This page is the engineering specifications for the
			entire ZORALab's Hestia Project. It is meant for
			developers to reference to and from while developing
			new project.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are primarily 3 goals:
			<ol>
				<li><p>
					<b>FROM THE PAST</b><br/>To archive
					legacy algorithms for the purposes of
					continuous improvements and future
					learning use.
				</p></li>

				<li><p>
					<b>AT PRESENT</b><br/>To provide
					engineering details for development and
					utilizing the libaries offered by
					ZORALab's Hestia.
				</p></li
>
				<li><p>
					<b>INTO THE FUTURE</b><br/>To serve as
					an industrial education tool and
					research and development baseline.
				</p></li>
			</ol>

		<h2>Technical Values</h2>
		<p>
			There are some engineering values that ZORALab's Hestia
			maintains in order to offer stable services to anyone,
			everyone. These were formed based on cumulated
			experiences in the past and using their insights to
			prevent it from happening again.

				<h3>Assimilate Dependencies</h3>
				<p>
					<b>DO NOT, as in STRICTLY DON'T
					INTEGRATE EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES</b>.
					Read (and audit) them codes; Understand
					or procure algorithm; then assimilate it
					into ZORALab's Hestia.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problems with integrations are
					always related to supply chain and
					geopolitical nuisance; unnecessary
					and resources wasting dramas, and etc.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='column' style='max-width:400px;'>
				<h3>Regressively Improvable</h3>
				<p>
					<b>ALWAYS DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE
					RECURSIVELY IMPROVABLE</b>. Improve the
					existing; not keep rolling new product
					just for each iterations. Make sure the
					product is <b>improvable, measurable,
					testable, documentable, and
					presentable</b>.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='column' style='max-width:400px;'>
				<h3>Provide Integration Services</h3>
				<p>
					<b>DO OFFER THE BEST INTEGRATION
					SERVICES TO CUSTOMER</b>. Allow
					customers to integrate ZORALab's Hestia
					easily; or have the freedom to
					assimilate directly from us.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='column' style='max-width:400px;'>
				<h3>Appreciates and Recognizes</h3>
				<p>
					<b>ALWAYS APPRECIATES AND RECOGNIZES
					ALL CONTRIBUTORS, BIG OR SMALL</b>. No
					being left behind. Resources are scarce;
					Compliment, not compete with the
					existing teams.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='column' style='max-width:400px;'>
				<h3>Steadly Push Towards Extreme</h3>
				<p>
					<b>ALWAYS PUSH AND OPTIMIZE TO THE
					EXTREME POSSIBLE IN A STABLE AND
					CONFIDENT MANNER</b>. Choose the best of
					the best for everyone to benefits from
					and trusted with.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='column' style='max-width:400px;'>
				<h3>Stays Open For Distruption</h3>
				<p>
					<b>ALWAYS KEEP OPEN END FOR ANY FUTURE
					DISTRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES</b>. Leave room
					for possible metamorphosis improvements.

		<h2>Common Convetions</h2>
		<p>
			To ensures we have common understanding for
			contributions, we established some conventions that are
			being used across all divisions. This does not limits
			each division to impose its additional conventions
			specific to itself.
		</p>


		<div class='row'>
			<div class='column' style='max-width:400px;'>
				<h3><code>X_</code> Prefix for Experimentals</h3>
				<p>
					<code>X_</code> or <code>x_</code>
					prefix on an identifier (e.g. name)
					stands for experimental and things may
					break. Examples:
					<code>X_S16_TrimWhitespace</code> (Go),
					<code>x_s16_trim_whitespace</code>
					(Rust), or
					<code>X_core_designer.html</code>
					(Hugo). When in doubt, always do this to
					let customer knows something is
					experimental.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='column' style='max-width:400px;'>
				<h3>Unique Tracking Identifier</h3>
				<p>
					Ensures all features, products, artists,
					developers, etc are uniquely identified
					in the project. This is
					inter-transatable Project so common
					name conflicts can be disasterous.
					Example: for <code>core_hestiaUI</code>
					Hugo component; it is translated to
					<code>hestiaUI/Core</code> in Go and
					<code>hestia_ui::Core</code> in Rust.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class='column' style='max-width: 400px;'>
				<h3>Always Semi-Automatic</h3>
				<p>
					Keep things semi-automatic - scripting,
					semi-automation tool, etc. These
					libraries are eventually for human to
					main at scale beyond reach. We need the
					best of both worlds to complement one
					another.
				</p>
