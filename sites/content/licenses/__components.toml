# HESTIA PAGE-LEVEL WEB UI COMPONENTS LIST
# ========================================
# All Hestia internal web UI components for this page.
#
# The components' low-level codes are auto-generated from hestiaGO code
# libraries for rendering consistency between non-WASM users and WASM users.
#
# If you're using WASM from Hestia code libraries and they are directly
# controlling the page UI (either as single-page rendering or reactive
# rendering), you **SHOULD NOT** include anything below as they're duplicates
# and can cause confusing complications. Please stick to ONE(1) rendering
# method.
#
# You SHOULD ONLY include components that are used in this page. To configure:
#     [[List]]
#     Name = "COMPONENT"
#     Include = true
#     Variables = [
#            { "--variable-1" = "1rem" },
#            { "--variable-2" = "2rem" },
#     ]
#
#     List.{POSITION}.Name      = name of the component (string)
#     List.{POSITION}.Include   = inclusion decision (bool true/false)
#     List.{POSITION}.Variables = list of overriding variables to the component.
#
# NOTE:
#     1) The position of the component listing influences the variables
#        overriding sequence. Please construct your list properly.
#     2) Check out Hestia's hestiaGUI catalog list for supported UI components

#
# EXAMPLE:
#        [[List]]
#        Name = "zoralabCORE"
#        Include = true
#        Variables = [
#                  { "--test-variable-1" = "1rem" },
#                  { "--test-variable-2" = "2rem" },
#        ]
#
#        [[List]]
#        Name = "googleFONT_NOTOSANS"
#        Include = true
#        Variables = []
#
#        ...
