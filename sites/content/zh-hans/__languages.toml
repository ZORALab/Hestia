# AVAILABLE TRANSLATION PAGES
# ===========================
# Data pattern:
#                [{[code]}{-[Script]}{-[COUNTRY]}]
#                URL = "[URL]"
# Examples:
#                [en]
#                URL = "/en/my-page-here/"
#
#                [zh-Hans]
#                URL = "/zh-hans/我的网站这儿/"
#
# NOTE:
#   1. The language code **MUST** be one of the Hestia site-level languages.
#      Otherwise, error shall be thrown.
#   2. If you need to use external pages, set the internal page's settings to
#      redirect immediately towards it.
#   3. If the URL is left empty (""), that translation page is disabled.
#   4. Hestia compatible URL (ONLY .Languages data structure is usable) can
#      be accepted in the .Lang.URL fields (see example above).

URL = '/en/'
