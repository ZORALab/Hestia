Before we continue, let's understand how hestiaHUGO manage page compilations.
If you take a look at the `content/en` page, there are a lot of double
underscore TOML files. Due to the complexities of web connectivities across the
Internet, we do not have a choice but to split them into various pieces of
config data. One constant to remember: never touch the Hugo's original
**_index.html** file. It is now ONLY USE for hugo to discover and map the site
directories. The way hestiaHUGO is designed will rarely have any conflict with
other Hugo themes. You're still allowed to place any page associated files
(e.g. images only this page uses, docs, .csv, etc) in the same directory. Each
known files' roles and responsibilities are listed below:
'''
Code = '''
__assets.toml            ➤ manage all CSS and JS files' inclusion or compilation
__components.toml        ➤ list out all hestiaHUGO UI components for compilation

the page and you'll observe your 404 page is disco-ing with colors.

To maintain balance between freedom of expression and rigidity for consistent
output, there are 2 things to remember: (1) hestiaHUGO can only quickly help you
process the base level dataset of known common data types (e.g. authors,
page type, etc); and (2) you need to add in the page context-specific dataset
(e.g. recipe steps, etc).

By default, hestiaHUGO supports JSON output type as secondary output format.
This is using the hestiaHUGO internal feature; not the Hugo one. Like LD+JSON,
you can construct a customer usable dataset using the Go template function.
Unlike LD+JSON, this is a pure JSON output (viewable by appending 'index.json'
at the end of the page URL) unrestricted by Schema.org schematic. The
responsible file defined by '__page.toml's '.Source.JSON' value (default is the
relative '__content.hestiaJSON'). Since this is 404 page, we can leave it as it
is. You can study the default codes for educational purposes.

5 main reasons: (1) Allows one to use hestiaHUGO as a CDN-driven open data API
server; (2) A backup reason for using Hugo after search engine giants nearly
destroyed SEO in the past solely for SMO ad revenues; (3) Provides
alternatives and freedom compared to LD+JSON implementations; (4) making
sure hestiaHUGO can support multiple output feature natively in a very
consistent manner; (5) Facilitate a way to feed AI training data. The default
processor is configured in a way as an option for those who do not want to use
it so if you're not using it, don't bother touching '__content.hestiaJSON' file
at all.

If you haven't realize, hestiaHUGO only takes 1 set of input dataset and
generated to various outputs type while supporting multiple languages at the
same time. In fact, it generates more like page-level 'sitemap.xml' and
'sitemap-page.xml' as well. This is one of the problem we're trying to solve when
using Hugo: 1 consistent input dataset to multiple outputs consistently. These
are just a scratch of the surface. We will explore more as you go through the
tutorials walkthrough.
