Title = 'The hestiaHUGO Way'
Description = '''
Like any Hugo theme, hestiaHUGO supplies UI in its very unique way. However,
unlike any other themes, hestiaHUGO comes with its own data processor system and
rarely use most of Hugo features except its partial functions and image
processing functions. The main reason is because Hugo has a lot of output
inconsistences throughout its history. ZORALab been there the hard way and will
never make the same mistake twice. Along the web development journey, we picked
a lot of different lessons and values along the way. So, before you decide to
move forward, let's be clear about some notable non-compromising differences:
'''
Code = '''
1. You won't be using Markdown; or even frankenstiening it with Hugo's
   shortcode like Hugo recommended.

2. Design strongly for writing HTML and Go template functions (equipped with
   Hugo partial functions) for maximum portabilities.

3. HTML, CSS, and JS are treated as 1 single format: **WEB**. we do not split
   them like most CSS and JS frameworks did.

4. We are still complying to the browser's end-user rendering degredation rule
   (HTML-only ➔ HTML+CSS only (e.g. JS blocker) ➔ HTML+CSS+JS), carrying no
   assumption of visitors' browsing nature.

5. All page layouts are supplied at UI component level, each with its own web
   formats (HTML, CSS, CSS Variables, JS).

6. We **COMPILE** pages; not just rendering. Each page is contained on its own.

7. At page layout level, we prioritizes HTML+CSS approach, especially when the
   very powerful CSS variables is made available.

8. We are extremely data-driven due to multiple languages support and even
   supply our own data type+value sanitization functions.

to check the package integrity before use. The are 2 ways to do this: GPG or
SHASUM. In this tutorial, we will be using SHASUM as shown in the following code
snippet. This should generate a HASHED_VALUE mathematically. Your job is to make
sure the HASHED_VALUE is 100% exactly the same as displayed at the releases
portal.

Now that you the package ready, it's time to setup your git repository. Firstly,
create and initialize your Git repo directory (for this entire tutorial, we're
going to call it 'DemoHestia'). In it, you can create your hugo directory (by
default, we recommend 'sites'). Then, proceed to create a 'themes' directory
inside it. Once done, unzip the hestiaHUGO package into the 'themes' directory.
The results should be something as such:
'''
Code = '''

to move it out to hugo directory (sites/) in order to use it. Depending on

to the Hugo directory. The result should be something as such:

root: initialized hugo for site creation.

There is a need to initialize a hugo repository for building
the static website. Hence, we have to start the efforts before
building any web content. Let's do this.

This patch is created to initialize hugo in the repository.

In the future, in case you need to update the hestiaHUGO, you just need to
replace your 'themes/hestiaHUGO' directory with the updated package. Hugo
reconfiguration is not required unless the release note specify it. Remember
that updating the engine may break your edge-cases inline customization so while
we try not to break backward compatibilty, you should allocate some times
to audit all your content pages' UI are updated with the latest API calls.
